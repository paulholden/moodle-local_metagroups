=========================================

- Meta-course enrolment (build 2013110500 or later)

Installation
------------
Copy the metagroups folder into your Moodle /local directory and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Usage

switch for further instructions on script usage).

Any future amendments to groups in 'child' courses will be reflected in linked meta-courses.
