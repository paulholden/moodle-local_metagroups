Moodle Meta-course Group Synchronization
=========================================

Requirements
------------
- Moodle 2.6 (build 2013111800 or later)
- Meta-course enrolment (build 2013110500 or later)

Installation
------------
Copy the metagroups folder into your Moodle /local directory and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Usage
-----
After installation you may need to synchronize existing meta-course groups, to do this run the cli/sync.php script (use the --help
switch for further instructions on script usage).

Any future amendments to groups in 'child' courses will be reflected in 'parent' courses that use groups.
